# web-app

- ~~New modules for missing components.~~
- ~~Page.js for the routing.~~
- ~~ftdomdelegate for the click behaviours.~~
- ~~fruitmachine on the client side.~~
- ~~Find better ways of splitting codepaths between client and server.~~
- ~~Teardown views, don't just rip them out.~~
- Add data sync.
- Add AppCache.
- ~~Make refresh button when server rendered (I think I need fruitmachine modules that can capture controller logic)~~
- ~~Separate the client from server logic from lib/modules~~
- ~~Consider making the pane.start method part of the routers~~
- ~~Rename routes to controllers :/~~

Clean up:

- Move all views to the views folder.
- Convert module views to proper templates (not straight javascript).
- Functional testing framework setup.

Ideas that have come out of this:
- Re-implemented with web components.
