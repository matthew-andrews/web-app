# web-app

- ~~New modules for missing components.~~
- ~~Page.js for the routing.~~
- ftdomdelegate for the click behaviours.
- fruitmachine on the client side.
- ~~Find better ways of splitting codepaths between client and server.~~

Clean up:

- Move all views to the views folder.
- Convert module views to proper templates (not straight javascript).

Ideas that have come out of this:
- Re-implemented with web components.
